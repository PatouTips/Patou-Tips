I have an Excel file named "SalesData.xlsx" containing a "SalesDetail" sheet with sales data organized in a specific way. I want to create a Power Query that performs the following transformations in the PowerBI file opened and named "Test 2 Fact_Sales":

1. Load the data from this Excel file located at: "YOUR OWN ADRESS\SalesData.xlsx"

2. The data is currently transposed (the dates are likely in rows instead of columns). Therefore, I need to transpose the table.

3. Transform the first row into column headers.

4. Denormalize all columns except "City", "Category", "Subcategory", and "Country" to transform the date columns into rows, with the column names in a "Date" column and the values ​​in a "Value" column.

5. Reorder the columns. Order: Date, Country, City, Category, Subcategory, Value

6. Add three new calculated columns:

"Product": concatenation of Category and Subcategory with a space

"ProductCode": concatenation of Category and Subcategory without a space

"CountryCode": concatenation of Country and City

7. Define the appropriate data types (Date: date, Value: integer, remainder: text)

8. Perform a left outer join with another table named "PricingProduct" on the "ProductCode" column to retrieve the prices

9. Extract only the "Price" column from this join

Can you generate the Power Query M code to perform all these transformations?
